# ANN_CIFAR-10_imageclassifaction
Image classification with ANN created using only numpy and then using Pytorch 

In this lab, I started off by constructing a neural networks from scratch to get a stronger understanding of what is required to make neural networks work.

Then in the second part of the lab you will train a neural network (using PyTorch) to classify an image into one of two classes: "car" or "truck". The code for the neural networks you train will be written for you, and you are not (yet!) expected to understand all provided code. However, by the end of the lab, you should be able to:

Understand at a high level the training loop for a machine learning model.
Understand the distinction between training, validation, and test data.
The concepts of overfitting and underfitting.
Investigate how different hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, affect the success of training.
Compare an ANN (aka Multi-Layer Perceptron) with a CNN.
